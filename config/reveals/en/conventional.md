# Conventional Power Plants <img src="../../static/stemp_abw/img/energy_icons/Kraftwerk_Thermisches_Kraftwerk_technologieneutral.svg" alt="Kraftwerk" width="35">

Conventional power plants include all power plants fed from fossil sources.

The following power plants are included in this tool (as of the end of 2018):

## Net electrcity generation capacity > 10 megawatt

- 2 Gas-fired power plants (106 MW, 40MW)
- 1 Lignite-fired power plants (49 MW)

They run with simplified consistent feed-in power and typical/common data for the annual load hours are used:

- Gas-fired power plants (turbine): 1250 h/a
- Gas-fired power plants (CCGT): 2900 h/a
- Lignite-fired power plants: 7000h/a

## Net electrcity generation capacity < 10 megawatt

21 power plants with a power range of 750 kW to 9,9 MW fall under this category. 
Additional assumptions are the heat-controlled operation with 5000 annual full load hours.
