Use this tool to get an overview of land use and the energy system in your region. Play around with the energy system and compare the results with reference scenarios.

- In the category **region** you can explore the region at its present state. General or energy related data such as population density, installed capacity of renewable energy plants or electricity demand can be displayed for each community in the region. With just a click on the community further information can be viewed.

- Define your own **energy system** for the region in the category energy system. Choose a reference scenario and change production and consumption data based on this scenario. The reference scenario currently available is the status quo (2017)

- The category **areas** allows you to have a look at and adjust available prirority areas for wind energy. In **static areas** you can highlight areas and a various number of territories which are relevant for planning new wind turbines. Buffer zones surrounding residential areas are one of many examples. This is based on the current legal requirements. If you select the free extensions option in the **energy system** category for the extension scenario, you will be able to adapt usable areas for wind energy in **variable areas**. As an example, buffer zones surrounding residential areas can now be adapted. This also changes the available potential for wind turbines in **the energy system**.

- Compare the **results** of generation and consumption of the newly created energy system with the reference scenario. What share of consumption can be covered by renewable energies? What does the electricity mix look like? After running the **simulation**, these and other questions can be answered.

Have fun exploring!
